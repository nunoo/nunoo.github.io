Below are some quick links for engineering resources.

- [Code repositories](https://github.com/phoenixtechnologies-io/).
    - [Backend](https://github.com/phoenixtechnologies-io/backend) contains the backend code for everything related to Phoenix.
    - [Storefront UI](https://github.com/phoenixtechnologies-io/storefront-ui) contains the frontend code for anything buying customers see, namely the checkout experience.
    - [Portal UI](https://github.com/phoenixtechnologies-io/portal-ui) contains the frontend code for everything the merchants and support staff use, namely the CRM.
- Project tracking
    - We use [Zenhub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/engineering-65a17d6b85d4720f155882cb/board?repos=724928517,736437283,742637891,zh-Z2lkOi8vcmFwdG9yL1JlcG9zaXRvcnkvMTMzOTkzMzcx) for all project tracking, which uses Github’s native issues as a backing store. That means you can edit issues in either Zenhub, or GitHub and the changes will reflect in both. Check out [Zenhub’s Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd) to layer on top of GitHub.
    - When taking an item, please choose and assign items to yourself from the top of the project backlog. If there are no items available, please reach out to @Sean Teeling.
- [API Documentation](https://checkout-docs.netlify.app/)
    - This hosts our current API docs.
    - If you’d like to see a diff between the current and prior doc:
        1. Click the “Download” button near the top of the API doc's page.
        2. Find the most [recent merged pull request](https://github.com/phoenixtechnologies-io/backend/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged), and visit the “Deploy Preview” link, and download its Api doc.
        3. Run the 2 docs through a diff tool, like `diff` or `colordiff`. You can also find [online diff tools](https://www.diffchecker.com/).
